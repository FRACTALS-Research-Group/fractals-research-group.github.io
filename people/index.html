His research is located in the multidisciplinary field of Systems Biology. His activities range from the definition of mathematical models of complex (biological) systems to the simulation of their temporal dynamics by means of deterministic, stochastic or hybrid algorithms. He also defines and applies different methodologies for the analysis of the emergent behavior of the systems under investigation (e.g., parameter sweep analysis, parameter identifiability, sensitivity analysis). His research effort also concerns the definition, implementation (for CPUs and GPUs) and application of Artificial Intelligence methods to problems in the fields of Bioinformatics, Systems Biology and Biomedicine, like, for instance, inferring the full haplotype of a cell starting from read sequencing data, estimating the unknown information of a complex system (e.g., molecular concentrations and kinetic constants in the case of biological systems), enhancing the appearance and visual quality of biomedical images. He has already successfully applied different methods, such as Particle Swarm Optimization, Genetic Algorithms and Deep Neural Networks, to these problems </div> </div> </article> <script>

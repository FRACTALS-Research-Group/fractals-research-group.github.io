### **F**air and **R**esponsible **A**lgorithms for **C**omplex-systems, **T**herapeutics, **A**strophysics and **L**ife-**S**ciences

---

The **FRACTALS Research Group** is an interdisciplinary powerhouse that operate at the intersection of  **Bio-Medicine**, **Astrophysics** , **Complex Systems** and **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**, to solve the world's most daunting computational challenges.

---

### **The Mission: Beyond the Black Box**

In an era of opaque AI, we don’t just build models; we build **trust**. We believe that a scientific discovery is only as good as its transparency. FRACTALS stands for **Fair and Responsible Algorithms**—interpretable, mathematically sound, and ethically grounded frameworks designed to ensure that the computational revolution remains equitable and verifiable.

> *"FRACTALS is where the power of supercomputing meets the rigor of human ethics. We are decoding the future, one interpretable algorithm at a time."*

### **Research Pillars: Where Physics Meets Life**

Our research is the thread that connects seemingly distant domains through the lens of **Complex Systems**:

- <i class="fas fa-pills"></i> **Therapeutics:** Disrupting traditional **Drug Discovery** pipelines using interpretable AI to identify candidates and molecular targets faster and safer.
* <i class="fas fa-hospital-user"></i> **Medicine:** Developing advanced clinical diagnostics and precision healthcare models to translate complex data into life-saving patient outcomes.
- <i class="fas fa-star"></i> **Astrophysics:** Decoding the silent language of **Cosmic Rays**, transforming chaotic high-energy data into physical insights about our universe.
- <i class="fas fa-network-wired"></i> **Biological Systems:** Mastering the non-linear dynamics that govern life, from intricate cellular networks to systemic health interactions.

### **The Triple-Core Academic Hub**

FRACTALS is more than a Research Group; it is a collaborative ecosystem.

We have established a unique **research corridor in Italy** by uniting the specialized expertise of three leading institutions: **Ca' Foscari University of Venice**, **University of Milano-Bicocca**, **University of Bergamo**.
Our synergy is amplified by an extensive **global network of international collaborations**, ensuring that the future of science is not only accelerated by technology but remains transparent, ethical, and globally connected.

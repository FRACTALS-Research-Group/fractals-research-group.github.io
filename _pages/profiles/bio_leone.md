<h6><i>Research Grant Holder @ University of Bergamo</i></h6>
<h6><i>Research Fellow @ Ca’ Foscari University of Venice</i></h6>
Master’s student in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano with a BSc in Computer Science (completed 1
year ahead of schedule) and an outstanding academic record, complemented by over five years of full-stack development
experience. Recently completed a one year research grant at Ca’ Foscari University of Venice on a Computational Astrophysics
high performance computing (HPC) project in collaboration with ICSC, INAF, and INFN.
Recently obtained a research grant at the University of Bergamo, where I am currently working on a project focused on evaluating the effectiveness of personalized rehabilitation protocols through biomechanical and physiological analysis.
Research focuses on Computational Intelligence (fuzzy logic, genetic programming, evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence, multi-objective optimization, and
neural networks) with applications in AI/ML. Authored seven peer-reviewed papers (five as first author), including published work
from my Bachelor’s thesis on AI/ML in the medical domain. Ongoing research explores Interpretable AI for explainable diagnosis
and Deep Learning methods in Computational Pathology. My combined background in industry and academic research enables
eﬀective translation of theoretical advances in Computational Intelligence into applied systems across diverse domains.

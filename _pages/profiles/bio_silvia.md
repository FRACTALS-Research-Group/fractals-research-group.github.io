Silvia Multari is a Ph.D. Candidate in Science and Technology of Bio and Nano Materials at the Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, Department of Molecular Sciences and Nanosystems. She holds a bachelor’s degree in Pharmaceutical Biotechnology obtained at the University of Milan, and she is now specialising in computational applications to drug discovery, with a focus on the study of molecular interactions, combining physics-based and AI-driven approaches to investigate peptide and small-molecule binding. She was a visiting student at the Technical University of Eindhoven (Eindhoven, the Netherlands) in the Molecular Machine Learning group led by professor Francesca Grisoni, and then at the Kyoto Institute of Technology (Kyoto, Japan) under the supervision of professor Giuseppe Pezzotti. Her main expertise lies in the application of molecular dynamics simulations, molecular docking and machine learning.

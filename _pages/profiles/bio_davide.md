<h4><b>Davide Casarin</b></h4>
<h6><i>Bachelor’s Thesis Student @ Ca’ Foscari University of Venice</i></h6>
Davide Casarin is a final-year Bachelor’s student in Data Science at Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, where he has developed a strong foundation in mathematical modeling, statistical learning, and computational methods for data-intensive science.

He is currently conducting his Bachelor’s thesis research at University of Milano-Bicocca in collaboration with INFN and Ca’ Foscari University of Venice within a PNRR-funded research initiative. His work focuses on the numerical analysis and GPU-accelerated implementation of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) for optimization in physics-based models. By integrating stochastic modeling, high-performance computing, and parallel architectures, his research aims to advance scalable computational methodologies for complex dynamical systems.

His academic interests lie at the intersection of probability theory, optimization, and machine learning, with particular attention to theoretically grounded methods that translate into robust and efficient large-scale implementations.

In parallel with his academic trajectory, he has gained several years of professional experience as a Software Developer, working on cloud-native and mobile systems. His industry experience has strengthened his expertise in scalable software architecture, performance engineering, and the design of maintainable, production-grade systems—skills that directly inform his approach to scientific computing and research software development.
